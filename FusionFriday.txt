In 1920, Sir Eddington thought about the energy source of the sun: "A star is 
drawing on same vast reservoir of energy [...] we sometimes dream than man will 
one day learn how to release it and use for his service." 

Can be considered as fusion research kick-off.

For a single proton in the sun to fuse together with another proton, it takes 
approximately 10^9 years. Yes, that is 1000000000 years and, yes, that is very

In 1950, Soviet soldier Oleg Lavrentiev proposed in a letter to the Kremlin a

In 1968, the Soviet tokamak T3 reported a record temperature of 2 keV, that is

to do their own measurements. The values were confirmed and a lot of labs

The Q-value is an often used measure in fusion research: it is the fusion power

In the D+T fusion reaction, only 20 % of the released energy is stored in the He 
nucleus (the neutron takes the remaining 80 %). Thus, only 20 % of the released 
energy can be used for further plasma heating. This is why good confinement is 
vital for a reactor.

A plasma consists of charged particles. This is why magnetic fields can be used

stellarator and tokamak, where the tokamak is (in performance) one generation

The magnetic field configuration in a tokamak is created by external coils and 
a strong current flowing in the plasma, whereas in a stellarator only external 
coils are used. The first one is simpler to construct, the latter more suitable

The dominant loss mechanisms in tokamak & stellarator are due to small-scale 
turbulence driven by strong gradients in plasma pressure. They can, however, 
be strongly reduced by a self-organized state, called the H-mode. For this 
you need: heating power, divertor.

Where a conventional tokamak looks like a donut, a spherical tokamak looks like 
a cored apple. The latter has lower magnetic fields, but you get more plasma for 
it (higher plasma-ß). Due to the reduced size, however, heat fluxes to the walls 
are higher.

The hydrogen isotopes Deuterium & Tritium will be used in fusion reactors.

In the D+T fusion process, an alpha particle and a neutron are created. The

The magnetic field lines in a tokamak and a stellarator have to be twisted

Plasma disruptions are the sudden loss of confinement in a tokamak due to

Cross sections of plasmas in tokamaks are not circular but elongated in the 
vertical direction,often D-shaped. The reason is to have a shear at the 
outboard side, i.e. a change of the inclination of the magnetic field line

Wendelstein W7-AS was the predecessor of W7-X, the world largest stellarator. 
It was operated from 1988-2002 in Garching. W7-AS was the first stellarator to

Neutral beam injection is a method to heat a plasma: neutral particles with 
energies in the 100 keV range are injected into the plasma and are immediately 
ionized via collisions with electrons or ions. Further collisions result in 
energy transfer to the plasma.

In inertial confinement fusion, a Deuterium-Tritium pellet is compressed on very

A tokamak has a toroidal electric field (transformer effect) initially 
accelerating free electrons which then start a plasma discharge via collisions. 
Some electrons, runaway electrons, are too fast for collisions. Their energies 
can approach relativistic levels.

The INTOR project started in 1973 by a meeting between Nixon & Brezhnev. They 
agreed that cooperating in fusion research would help to ease tension between 
them. Regular workshops were held, identifying research needs & building the 
basis for what led later to ITER.

A new fusion device saw its first plasma yesterday: MAST Upgrade at Culham (UK). 
It's a spherical tokamak which is a more compact version of a conventional 
tokamak. Its potential for a fusion reactor will be investigated + plasma 
exhaust questions relevant for ITER.

If the plasma pressure increases, currents flowing in the plasma also increase, 
stabilizing the pressure. These currents influence the background magnetic field 
and result in a shift of the plasma, the Shafranov shift. It it's too large the 
plasma becomes unstable.

Tokamak plasmas can experience initial perturbations resulting in vertical 
movement. Forces from magnetic field & plasma current enhance the displacement, 
plasma eventually hits the vessel (Vertical Displacement Event). Passive & 
active control is therefore applied.

Pushing a tokamak plasma to high performance is not straight-forward as there 
are many parameters to vary. A very nice way to understand this is a tokamak 
simulator from @PPPL, found here: https://ippex.pppl.gov/#vt 
My highscore: 334 - can you beat it?

In the CNO cycle, 4 protons are fused to an alpha particle using carbon, 
nitrogen, oxygen as catalysts. It plays a minor role in our sun but is dominant 
in heavier stars. Being known since 90 years,1st experimental evidence 
(neutrinos) has been reported this week.

The largest super-conducting tokamak in the world, JT-60SA, has reached 
super-conductivity temperatures in all coils. On the other hand, the vessel 
walls are currently heated up (above 100°C) to get rid of impurities. First 
plasma is scheduled for early next year.

Important contributions by female researchers to fusion science - a thread.

Donna Strickland, Nobel Prize 2018. Her work allowed to create incredibly 
intense laser pulses which are mandatory in laser fusion.

#FusionFriday #WomenInScience #WomenInFusion

Sanae-Inoue Itoh. She contributed heavily to the model of how the transition 
into the H-mode works. The H-mode is a type of plasma configuration in which 
confinement suddenly increases, allowing to reduce the overall size of a 
potential fusion power plant.

Annick Pouquet. She pioneered a lot of computational & theoretical research on 
magneto-hydrodynamical turbulence, e.g. on the understanding of the energy 
transfer between different scales. While her work was about astrophysical 
plasmas, it is also adapted to fusion plasmas.

Xenija (Ksenija) Razumova. Since the very beginning of fusion research, she 
contributed to experimental research on tokamaks. Of particular importance was 
her achievement of a stable plasma scenario in the TM-2 tokamak, marking the 
beginning of the world-wide tokamak dominance.

Katherine Weimer. Her theoretical research and models of plasma equilibrium were 
the basis on which the early stellarators in Princeton, @PPPLab, were 
constructed, although she contributed to both, tokamak and stellarator research.

Sibylle Günter. She is head of Max Planck Institute for Plasma Physics, 
@PlasmaphysikIPP, home of the world largest stellarator and EU's largest tokamak. 
Besides her important theoretical contributions on tokamak transport, she is 
strongly pushing forward education in fusion.

This is just a small, far from complete list, and I ask you to add more by 
replying to this thread.

Currently, @FuseNet_eu is finalizing a new book on fusion technology will be 
freely available (as a follow-up to the free @iaeaorg book "Fusion Physics"). 
At the moment, there is a competition about the book cover. Feel free to 
contribute: https://fusenet.eu/textbook-cover-contest

First Light Fusion @FLFusion is a privately funded company doing inertial 
confinement: a rail gun accelerates a copper projectile to 30 km/s. Hitting a 
plastic target, shock waves should compress a fusion-fuel filled cavity in its 
center to fusion conditions.
